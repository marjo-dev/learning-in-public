    <h2>Coding Challenge #1</h2>
    <span>completed 8/21</span>
    <p>
      Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
      calculated using the formula:<br />
      BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height
      in meter).
    </p>
    <h4>Your tasks:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables</li>
      <li>
        Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
        versions)
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
        whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Test data:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and
        is 1.95 m tall.
      </li>
      <li>
        Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and
        is 1.76 m tall.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Coding Challenge #2</h2>
    <span>completed 8/21</span>
    <p>
      Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
      improve it.
    </p>
    <h4>Your tasks:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The
        message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is
        higher than Mark's!"
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.
        Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰</p>
